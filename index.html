<h2 id="coursedescription">Course description</h2>

<p>Designed for English majors and minors, this course examines three intertwined
questions: What is literature? Why do we read it? and How do we read it? As we
will see, any attempt to answer these three questions will take us through
various historical, spatial, political, and cultural fields. More precisely,
the course will follow a path of engaging with primarily American,
English-language aesthetic objects (poems, plays, novels, short stories,
essays) alongside a wider scholarly apparatus that has tried to
codify, restrict, (de)politicize, champion, demystify, appropriate, critique,
quantify, or simply complicate those objects. In so doing, we will see how the
study of literature has several histories, geographies, and politics in its
relationship with various cultures.</p>

<h2 id="courserequirementspolicies">Course requirements &amp; policies</h2>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<h4 id="plenarysessions">Plenary sessions</h4>

<p>English 101 features four plenary sessions led by four faculty members in the
English department. With these sessions, the faculty will give you the
opportunity to be exposed both to the diverse set of interests that occupy our
department as well as the diverse faculty itself. Each faculty member will be
presenting on work that we will have read in class. The plenaries are scheduled
for Thursdays and Fridays, as noted below. </p>

<h4 id="participation">Participation</h4>

<p><strong>25%</strong> The success of any course is directly related to the levels of engagement
brought both by the instructor and the students. As such, class participation
is vitally important. Similarly, though attendance is logically required for
class participation, it is not sufficient. This class requires active
participation both inside the classroom and outside. </p>

<p>You can miss up to three meetings without penalty, and you can use these
opportunities tactically, to provide space and time to either fulfill other
obligations or recuperate from the previous night. I don’t care why you didn’t
come. I start to care with the fourth absence, and I start to require
documentation. Repeated unexcused absence quickly gobbles up the class
participation component of the grade and begins to threaten your ability to
even <em>pass</em> the course.</p>

<p>Plenaries <em>cannot be missed</em>.</p>

<p>In a discussion-oriented class, “active participation” involves the following
components. All of these are necessary to receive maximum points for
participation:</p>

<ul>
<li>being in class on time,</li>
<li>arriving having done the reading for that day,</li>
<li>having considered the reading and found points of entry into class discussion via questions about specific passages,</li>
<li>participating in class discussion in ways that build upon contributions from others, and</li>
<li>refraining from the use of electronic devices.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="firstessay">First essay</h4>

<p><strong>15%</strong> The first essay will be in response to a prompt. It should be 900–1200 words
long.</p>

<h4 id="secondessay">Second essay</h4>

<p><strong>10%</strong> The second essay features a reading of a passage from a work we have
read for class. You should show the passage’s importance to the text as a
whole. This essay should also be 900–1200 words long. It should also
include, marked on the page, the various “templates” (in the Graff and
Birkenstein sense) you make use of. It should be handed in by 5 p.m. on the
due date in my mailbox on the second floor of 244 Greene St.</p>

<h4 id="secondessayrewrite">Second essay rewrite</h4>

<p><strong>10%</strong> The rewrite of the second essay is an opportunity to build upon the
second essay by incorporating some of the additional texts you have been
exposed to in the presentations. This rewrite should be 1200–1500 words
long, and it should also feature the aforementioned templates.</p>

<h4 id="presentation">Presentation</h4>

<p><strong>20%</strong> Throughout the semester, secondary texts have been paired with with
primary reading for that day. At the beginning of the semester, you will
choose a secondary text and present on it later in the semester. The
presentation should be 10–15 minutes long. A good presentation will provide
context for the secondary text itself, feature a thorough summary of the
secondary text and its argument, and close with links between the secondary
text and that day’s primary text. Slides, etc., are not necessary. The
presentation will be accompanied by a short document (800 words) laying out
the same information as the presentation did to be turned in at the same
time as the presentation.</p>

<p>The texts for the presentations will not be easy to read, understand, or even
summarize. These presentations will, hence, require time to prepare. As with
any assignment, make use of office hours to help clarify any questions you may
have.</p>

<h4 id="finalessay">Final essay</h4>

<p><strong>20%</strong> The final essay is a critical work on one of the primary texts we have
read. It should build on the reading techniques from the first two essays
as well as make use of at least one of the secondary texts from the course.
A short précis of the essay (up to 600 words) is due two weeks earlier. It
should be the essay in miniature—a prose outline, illustrating the essay’s
structure, context, and argument.</p>

<p>Because of the expanded context and argument, the essay will include some added
research, aided by the skills learned at the library. The strategies Graff and
Birkenstein provide will help frame this context and build the argument. The
final version of the essay should be 1800–2200 words long.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<h4 id="assignments">Assignments</h4>

<p>The assignment instructions, though detailed in the syllabus, may be enhanced
or supplemented during the course. If you have any questions about an
assignment, you should ask for clarification early. The assignments are due on
the dates noted in the syllabus. </p>

<p>The writing can be submitted electronically, <em>except</em> for the second essay and
its rewrite, which must be submitted in paper form. I prefer 2up (two pages per
sheet), two-sided printing. Documents should be formatted sanely: 12pt type and
double-spaced.</p>

<p>Late assignments jeopardize both your and my rhythms in the class, so they will
be penalized. I will give you feedback and will happily discuss any work with
you, but grades should be considered final.</p>

<h4 id="attendance">Attendance</h4>

<p>As indicated above, attendance is required. Three absences will be excused
without supplemental documentation, and I encourage you to use these
tactically. Catching up is your responsibility.</p>

<p>Subsequent absence requires formal documentation. Otherwise it begins to harm
your final grade. Though class participation is only part of the final grade,
extreme absenteeism (more than six meetings missed) will put your ability to
pass the course at risk.</p>

<p>Please show up on time to class, as well.</p>

<h4 id="electronics">Electronics</h4>

<p>Our time in class is meant as a sanctuary from the distractions of the rest of
the world. Additionally, our class relies on discussion and engagement, and the
front of a laptop screen is a brilliant shield behind which a student can hide,
even unintentionally. During our meetings, then, there can be no use of
electronic devices. Please also set whatever devices you have but aren’t using
to silent mode.</p>

<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>

<p>Communication is vitally important to the pedagogical process, and this course
depends on clear communication in both directions. If you have questions,
comments, or concerns, the best course of action is to come visit me during my
office hours as noted at the top of this document. If your questions, etc., cannot
wait until then, then clearly you can also email me. I should respond within
48 hours, but please write again if I do not.</p>

<p>This is a new course, meaning that there will be even more unfinished edges
ready to scratch someone than in a typical course. We have a collective goal of
learning, however, so if the unfinished edges get to be overwhelming, I’ll
adjust the parameters of the course appropriately. I’m not out to catch you,
nor is this course a process of grotesque punishment. Please don’t treat it as
such.</p>

<p>Once more, with feeling: <em>communication is vitally important to the pedagogical
process</em>. If you have concerns or worries, please let me know about them sooner
rather than later.</p>

<h4 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h4>

<p>If you have a disability, you should register with the Moses Center for
Students with Disabilities (mosescsd@nyu.edu; 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor,
212.998.4980), which can arrange for things like extra time for assignments.
Please inform me <em>at the beginning of the semester</em> if you need any special
accommodations regarding the assignments.</p>

<h4 id="academicintegrity">Academic integrity</h4>

<p>Please look at NYU’s <a href="http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity">full statement on academic
integrity</a>. Any instance of
academic dishonesty will result in an F and will be reported to the relevant
dean for disciplinary action. Remember that plagiarism is a matter of fact, not
intention. Know what it is, and don’t do it.</p>

<h4 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h4>
