#### Plenary sessions

English 101 features four plenary sessions led by four faculty members in the
English department. With these sessions, the faculty will give you the
opportunity to be exposed both to the diverse set of interests that occupy our
department as well as the diverse faculty itself. Each faculty member will be
presenting on work that we will have read in class. The plenaries are scheduled
for Thursdays and Fridays, as noted below. 

#### Participation

**25%** The success of any course is directly related to the levels of engagement
brought both by the instructor and the students. As such, class participation
is vitally important. Similarly, though attendance is logically required for
class participation, it is not sufficient. This class requires active
participation both inside the classroom and outside.  

You can miss up to three meetings without penalty, and you can use these
opportunities tactically, to provide space and time to either fulfill other
obligations or recuperate from the previous night. I don’t care why you didn’t
come. I start to care with the fourth absence, and I start to require
documentation. Repeated unexcused absence quickly gobbles up the class
participation component of the grade and begins to threaten your ability to
even *pass* the course.

Plenaries *cannot be missed*.

In a discussion-oriented class, “active participation” involves the following
components. All of these are necessary to receive maximum points for
participation:

* being in class on time,
* arriving having done the reading for that day,
* having considered the reading and found points of entry into class discussion via questions about specific passages,
* participating in class discussion in ways that build upon contributions from others, and
* refraining from the use of electronic devices.

#### First essay

**15%** The first essay will be in response to a prompt. It should be 900–1200 words
long.

#### Second essay

**10%** The second essay features a reading of a passage from a work we have
read for class. You should show the passage’s importance to the text as a
whole. This essay should also be 900–1200 words long. It should also
include, marked on the page, the various “templates” (in the Graff and
Birkenstein sense) you make use of. It should be handed in by 5 p.m. on the
due date in my mailbox on the second floor of 244 Greene St.

#### Second essay rewrite

**10%** The rewrite of the second essay is an opportunity to build upon the
second essay by incorporating some of the additional texts you have been
exposed to in the presentations. This rewrite should be 1200–1500 words
long, and it should also feature the aforementioned templates.

#### Presentation

**20%** Throughout the semester, secondary texts have been paired with with
primary reading for that day. At the beginning of the semester, you will
choose a secondary text and present on it later in the semester. The
presentation should be 10–15 minutes long. A good presentation will provide
context for the secondary text itself, feature a thorough summary of the
secondary text and its argument, and close with links between the secondary
text and that day’s primary text. Slides, etc., are not necessary.  The
presentation will be accompanied by a short document (800 words) laying out
the same information as the presentation did to be turned in at the same
time as the presentation.

The texts for the presentations will not be easy to read, understand, or even
summarize. These presentations will, hence, require time to prepare. As with
any assignment, make use of office hours to help clarify any questions you may
have.

#### Final essay

**20%** The final essay is a critical work on one of the primary texts we have
read. It should build on the reading techniques from the first two essays
as well as make use of at least one of the secondary texts from the course.
A short précis of the essay (up to 600 words) is due two weeks earlier. It
should be the essay in miniature—a prose outline, illustrating the essay’s
structure, context, and argument.

Because of the expanded context and argument, the essay will include some added
research, aided by the skills learned at the library. The strategies Graff and
Birkenstein provide will help frame this context and build the argument.  The
final version of the essay should be 1800–2200 words long.
