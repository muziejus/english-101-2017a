Designed for English majors and minors, this course examines three intertwined
questions: What is literature? Why do we read it? and How do we read it? As we
will see, any attempt to answer these three questions will take us through
various historical, spatial, political, and cultural fields. More precisely,
the course will follow a path of engaging with primarily American,
English-language aesthetic objects (poems, plays, novels, short stories,
essays) alongside a wider scholarly apparatus that has tried to codify,
restrict, demystify, appropriate, critique, quantify, or simply complicate
those objects. In so doing, we will see how the study of literature has
several histories, geographies, and politics in its relationship with various
cultures.
